 * The DVS noise filter combines a HotPixel filter (high activity pixels),
 * a Background-Activity filter (uncorrelated events), and a
 * Refractory Period filter (limit event rate of a pixel).
 * The HotPixel and Background-Activity filters reduce noise due
 * to transistor mismatch, the Refractory Period filter can reduce
 * the event rate and is efficient to implement together with the
 * Background-Activity filter, requiring only one pixel memory
 * map for both.
 * Please note that the filter is not thread-safe, all function calls
 * should happen on the same thread, unless you take care that they
 * never overlap.
